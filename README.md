# Travel-Booking-CRUD-System
The provided Python code implements a fully functional **Travel Booking Management System** using the **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** paradigm and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. The system is centered around the `Booking` class, which serves as the data model, encapsulating all details for a single reservation, such as customer name, destination, date, and status. Each booking is automatically assigned a unique, short identifier using the `uuid` module, which is crucial for reliably searching and modifying records. The core of the application utilizes a global list named `bookings_db` to simulate an in-memory database where all created `Booking` objects are stored. Dedicated procedural functions like `create_booking`, `update_booking`, and `delete_booking` handle the persistent management of these objects, supported by helper functions such as `find_booking` and the robust `get_valid_input` function, which centralizes user input, handles non-empty checks, and performs basic type validation. Finally, the program is wrapped in a `main()` function that presents a clean, interactive command-line menu, allowing the user to select and execute the various CRUD operations until they choose to exit the system.
